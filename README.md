The PatientQueueManagementSystem is a C++ application designed to manage patient data in a hospital setting using a priority queue. The system allows for the addition of new patients, prioritizing them based on the urgency of their medical needs (Emergency, Follow up, General), and facilitates the removal and display of patients in the queue. Key features include validation of patient details such as name, phone number, and blood group, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. The system employs a priority queue data structure to efficiently manage patient order based on their priority levels.
